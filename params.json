{"name":"aur2ccr","tagline":"","body":"## aur2ccr \r\nPull information from AUR or Arch repos, and make source packages that are ready for uploading to CCR.\r\n\r\nThis script uses the information on converting Arch/AUR packages to CCR source packages from http://chakra-linux.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_upload_a_package_to_CCR_when_it_exists_on_Arch_or_Aur\r\n\r\n# Todo:\r\nSee issues (https://github.com/redhat69/aur2ccr/issues/).\r\nThis script is currently undergoing a rewrite from bash to Python, so new features will not be implemented until that change has been completed. \r\n\r\n# Installation:\r\nInstallation for aur2ccr is simple. Just run\r\n`ccr -S aur2ccr`, `ccr -S aur2ccr-git`, or \r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/redhat69/aur2ccr.git\r\n    cd aur2ccr\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nThis will install the script itself, the needed configuration files, and the **aur2ccr(8)** man page. There is no need for a `./configure`, as the script only works on one platform: Chakra Linux.\r\n\r\n# Configuration:\r\nTo configure aur2ccr, just run\r\n\r\n    aur2ccr --setup\r\n\r\nOr edit the configuration files in /etc/aur2ccr/ by hand. All configuration files in /etc/aur2ccr/ can also be copied to ~/.aur2ccr/. Local conf files take precedence over global ones. \r\n\r\n# Documentation:\r\nUsage information for this script can be found in the help output (`aur2ccr -h` or `aur2ccr --help`) and the man page (`man 8 aur2ccr`). Configuration options and files are documented in the aur2ccr man page (`man 8 aur2ccr`), and in the global configuration file (`less /etc/aur2ccr/aur2ccr.conf`).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
